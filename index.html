    <h1>Atlanta Tennis</h1>
    
    <p1>Random observations from a 12+ year Atlanta area tennis player/writer, and a lifelong enthusiast/evangelist of the greatest sport that (almost) anyone can play and enjoy. With ALTA, USTA, Ultimate Tennis and more, Atlanta is the (2nd?) Best Tennis Town in the United States of America!</p1>

    <h2>BBT Atlanta Open 2013 - pictures and videos from both finals</h2>
    
    <p2>Sunday was a beautiful day to conclude this year's <strong>BBT Atlanta Open</strong> at <strong>Atlantic Station</strong>, though not quite as cool as Saturday, a nice (if occasional) breeze could be felt during the latter stages of what turned out to  be the longest 3-set match of the year.  There were no breaks of serve and John Isner prevailed over Kevin Anderson 6-7 (3), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2).  Here are some pictures and videos (of the end of each set) from the singles and doubles finals on Sunday, July 28:</p2>
